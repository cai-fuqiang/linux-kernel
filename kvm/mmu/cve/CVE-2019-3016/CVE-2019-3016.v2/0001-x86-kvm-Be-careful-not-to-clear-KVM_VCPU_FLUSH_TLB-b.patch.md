Subject: [PATCH v2 1/5] x86/kvm: Be careful not to clear KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB
 bit

kvm_steal_time_set_preempted() may accidentally clear KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB
bit if it is called more than once while VCPU is preempted.

This is part of CVE-2019-3016.

(This bug was also independently discovered by Jim Mattson
<jmattson@google.com>)
