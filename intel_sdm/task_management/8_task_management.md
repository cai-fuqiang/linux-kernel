This chapter describes the IA-32 architecture’s task management facilities.
These facilities are only available when the processor is running in protected
mode.

> 该章节描述了 IA-32 task management 功能. 这些功能仅在 CPU 跑在保护模式下
> 生效.

This chapter focuses on 32-bit tasks and the 32-bit TSS structure. For
information on 16-bit tasks and the 16-bit TSS structure, see Section 8.6,
“16-Bit Task-State Segment (TSS).” For information specific to task management
in 64-bit mode, see Section 8.7, “Task Management in 64-bit Mode.”
