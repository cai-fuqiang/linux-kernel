An event caused by the PE counting the event is Attributable. If an agent other
than the PE that is counting the events causes an event, these events are
Unattributable.

> 由PE引起的事件计数该事件是 Attributable。 如果正在对事件进行计数的 PE 
> 之外的代理导致了事件，则这些事件 Unattributable.

An event is defined as being either Attributable or Unattributable. If the
event is Attributable, it is further defined whether it is Attributable to:

> 事件被定义为 不是 Attributable 就是 Unattributable。如果事件是Attributable，
> 则进一步定义其是否 Attributable 于：

* The current Security state of the PE.
* The current Exception level of the PE.
* When the PE is in Debug state, operations issued to the PE by the debugger
  through the external debug interface.
  > 当PE处于Debug state，调试器通过外部调试接口向PE发出操作。

In a multithreaded implementation, an event might be generated by another PE
with the same values for affinity level 1 and higher. This event is further
defined as Attributable to:

* The current Security state of that PE.
* The current Exception level of that PE.
* When that PE is in Debug state, operations issued to that PE by the debugger
  through the external debug interface.

See Multithreaded implementations on page D11-5258 for information about
enabling and restricting counting events in a multithreaded implementation.

An event can be defined as the combination of multiple subevents, which can be
either Attributable or Unattributable. 

> 一个事件可以定义为多个子事件的组合，这些子事件可以是 Attributable and or not

All architecturally defined events are Attributable, unless otherwise stated. 

> state: 陈述或说明（某事）（尤指仔细、详尽而明确地）
>
> 除非另有说明，所有架构定义的事件都是 Attributable

Unattributable events might be counted when Attributable events are not
counted. See: 

* Interaction with EL3 on page D11-5245. 
* Event filtering on page D11-5260. 
* Performance Monitors and Debug state on page D11-5264.

These sections are summarized by Table D11-1 on page D11-5253 for events
Attributable to the processor, and Unattributable events. Table D11-1 on page
D11-5253 entries apply when the counter and PMU are enabled and not frozen.
Otherwise, events are not counted.

> 条目适用。 否则，事件不被计算在内。
